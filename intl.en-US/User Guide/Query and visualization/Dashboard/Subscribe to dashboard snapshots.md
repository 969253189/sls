# Subscribe to dashboard snapshots {#concept_yhp_mmg_vgb .concept}

This topic describes how to subscribe to dashboard snapshots in Log Service. Specifically, you canÂ set for the system to send notifications about dashboard snapshots to specific email addresses or send notifications as DingTalk chatbot messages.

## Limits {#section_wqk_ws4_vgb .section}

-   You can create a maximum of one subscription for each dashboard.
-   In each day, Log Service can send up to fifty emails for each account.
-   The interval specified by a Cron expression must be at least one minute. However, we recommend that you set an interval of one hour or longer if you choose to use a Cron expression.
-   The maximum number of subscriptions and alert notifications that you can create for a Log Service project is 100. If you need to increase one or both of these quotas, open a ticket.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Dashboard**.

6.  Set notifications.

    Dashboard snapshot notifications can be sent to a specific email address or sent as a DingTalk chatbot message.

    -   Email

        In the **Recipients** box, enter an email address. You can also set the email **Subject**. If you do not set any email subject, Log Service uses `Log Service Report` as the default subject.
