# Service log dashboards {#concept_pkq_dvt_ngb .concept}

After the service log function is enabled, Log Service automatically creates five dashboards for displaying statistics relating to user operations, metering, Logtail log collection, Logtail exception monitoring, and consumption group monitoring.

## Dashboard description {#section_vsk_1zt_ngb .section}

When enabling the service log function, you can choose from the following log types:

-   If you select **Operational logs**, Log Service creates an [operation statistics](#) dashboard, displaying the statistics for the number of requests and the proportion of request failures on the current day.
-   If you select **Other logs**, Log Service creates dashboards for displaying [metering statistics](#section_ohd_jwt_ngb), [Logtail log collection statistics](#section_uzp_jwt_ngb), [Logtail running monitoring](#section_hsf_kwt_ngb), and [consumption group monitoring](#section_qt5_kwt_ngb).

## Operation statistics dashboard {#section_yhk_3wt_ngb .section}

This dashboard displays user access and operation information, such as the queries per second \(QPS\) and request delay for API requests and other operations on any of the resources under a Project.

## Metering statistics dashboard {#section_ohd_jwt_ngb .section}

This dashboard displays metering statistics, which include data storage, index traffic, data read and write operations, and read and write traffic.

## Logtail log collection statistics dashboard {#section_uzp_jwt_ngb .section}

This dashboard displays statistics relating to Logtail log collection.

## Logtail running monitoring dashboard {#section_hsf_kwt_ngb .section}
